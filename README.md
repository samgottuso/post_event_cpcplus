# post_event_cpcplus
This rmarkdown creates automatically generated reports that looks at our events on a quarterly basis.

To do: 
  * Get teammate feedback on important metrics to add.
  * Figure out if it's better deployed with a shiny app wrapper.
  * Finish the pie chart. 
  * Add more descriptive texts.
